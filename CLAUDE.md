# Instructions

  * Don't advertise in commit messages
  * Keep in mind that some users will run in Linux, some in WSL, and some on
    Windows.
  * In responding to my prompts, don't just start doing things.  Tell me what
    you're going to do and why, then get confirmation from me.
  * Don't ask me to visit URLs or read logs or copy output unless you can't do
    that yourself (or instrument the code to make it possible for you to get at
    that debug output)
  * When I SHOUT IN ALL CAPS or use profanity, it is because I am frustrated.
    Slow down, ask more questions, get confirmation on the correct path.  Don't
    just rush off and start trying random things.  Investigate and discuss to
    find the correct path before rushing toward a solution.
